# savannah-cli

Command line interface for the savannah framework.

`npm install -g savannah-cli`

**Work in progress**

## Create a project

- Type `savannah new dest` where `dest` is the destination folder for your project.
- Copy `savannah-core/src` (from the [savannah-core](https://github.com/hmil/savannah-core) repository) to `dest/src/core`. At some point this tool will include a package manager making this step unnecessary...
- `cd dest`
- `savannah run` to launch the game
